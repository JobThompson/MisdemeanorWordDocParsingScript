# MisdemeanorWordDocParsingScript

This is a script intended to parse a word document table that contains the OCGA code and Boilerplate for that charge and then create SQL insert statements for the data. The Word document data is dirty and requires validation and transformation. There is an implementation for checking the DB for matching existing OCGA code, but that is currently not in use.

This script was built for Python 3.10 or higher. 

The only reason this Repo is public is for work example reasons.
