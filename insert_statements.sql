Legal Opinion from Chuck Olson: The Georgia Supreme Court has repeatedly held that it is unconstitutional to prosecute violations of agency rules and regulations as criminal offenses until the rule or regulation has been ratified by the General Assembly. Every state agency is empowered to adopt rules and regulations that "implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of [the] agency," O.C.G.A. § 50-13-2(6), and "to carry into effect a law already enacted." Glustrom v. State, 206 Ga. 734, 736 (1950). Such rules or regulations, when adopted pursuant to a proper grant of authority by the legislature, have the force of law and may be enforced through either civil or administrative sanctions. Am. Medical Int'l v. Charter Lake Hosp., 186 Ga. App. 204, 207 (1988). However, the Georgia Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the General Assembly cannot constitutionally delegate its legislative authority to prescribe crimes and to fix the punishments to state agencies by making a violation of a regulation adopted by a state agency a crime. Glustrom v. State, supra; Sundberg v. State, 234 Ga. 482 (1975); Howell v. State, 238 Ga. 95, 95-96 (1976). Notwithstanding this constitutional prohibition, the General Assembly has, on more than one occasion, enacted statutes that include provisions that purport to make the violation of a rules, regulation, or order of a state agency a crime. See e.g., O.C.G.A. §§ 4-4-26; 4-4-48; 4-4-74; 4-4-127; 4-5-11; 4-6-10(a); 8-2-118; 10-1-169; 10-1-189; 10-2-22; 12-6-16(b); 12-6-17; 12-6-89(c); 12-6-176; 25-8-12; 25-11-16(d); 25-12-19(a); 26-2-88(c); 26-2-154; 26-2-320; 26-2-357; 26-2-377; 27-1-38; 31-13-13(a); 31-17-8; 31-19-10; 31-27-12; 38-3-7; 46-7-39; 50-16-37; 52-7-26. PLEASE NOTE that the fact that a rule or regulation cannot be enforced as a crime does not mean that an officer who is authorized to enforce it cannot issue a citation for a violation. The use of a citation as a method of notifying someone that they are accused of violating a regulation is an internal matter for the agency. However, such citations should not be filed with a court or referred to prosecuting attorney's office. You should return those citations to the commander of the Trooper who issued them so the Department may seek appropriate administrative sanctions against the offender. ');
